#Steps to execute the code->
1)All the files(Main.ipynb,train_data.csv,test_data.csv,log folder,readme.txt) should be in the same folder.
2)Start jupyter server and open Main.ipynb file.\
3)Run all cells.
4)Load file cell, will ask for file type, enter csv. Then, it asks for train file name and test file name. 
Train file name -> train_data.csv
Test file name -> test_data.csv
5)The next step is summary of every column. Its asks for column type of every column- 
write cat for every string column and cont for every continuous column.
For Categorical column, summary shows count of different string values and for continuous columns summary shows the histogram and the different statistics
6)If data types entered correctly, the rest of the code will execute properly.

#Results:-
If code is executed properly, the code will create multiple models for random forest, logistic regression, decision tree and SVM

At the end, we compare the graph of Fscores.
